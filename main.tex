\section{About}
  \vspace{-0.36cm}

Enthusiastic \textbf{MEng Electronics and Software Engineering graduate} embarking on a \textbf{PhD in Artificial Intelligence} at the University of Exeter. I have a keen interest in applications of machine learning and methods in ecological research. I am currently seeking opportunities complementary to my PhD, working with cutting-edge technologies wherein a strong foundation in electronics, software engineering, AI methods and ecological knowledge may be applied.

  {\jobtitle{Postgraduate (PhD) Researcher and Teaching assistant}\\
  My research is focused on the development of AI technologies for biodiversity monitoring. I am particularly interested in: how large-scale self-supervised foundation models can be leveraged for rapid ecological assessment, how explainable-AI techniques can be explored to build trust in learned representations from fine-grained and long-tailed training datasets and how AI can operate at the edge in conjunction with growing specialised conservation hardware solutions. I concurrently work as a Teaching Assistant.

  {\jobtitle{Software Developer \& Research Assistant}\\
  I worked primarily as the project lead for our software package, \linkrg{https://dynaikon.com/trap/}{DynAikonTrap}. This is a fully open-source camera trap with some AI capability and integration with our \linkrg{https://service.fastcat-cloud.org/api/spec}{web API} for observation logging. This is a novel design, using video encoding artefacts and convolutional neural networks to detect animal presence in a live video feed. Aspects are discussed in our \linkrg{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954122001066}{paper}. 
  \\
  As project lead I have been involved in every aspect of software development, communication, product support and liaison with our funding consortium. I also produced my final-year MEng \linkrg{https://gitlab.dynaikon.com/rossg/2190583_Gardiner_ENG5041P_Final_Year_Report/}{research project} from work completed on DynAikonTrap: successfully halving the system power consumption, accelerating our CNN detectors via weight quantisation and adding capability to distinguish humans from animals in video feed. 
  %Recently, I have been preparing for a workshop where I  introduce DynAikonTrap to a group of wildlife researchers at the Spanish National Research Council in Catalonia. We hope this will help the project gain traction and volunteers for the open source development effort.

  I enhanced my radar imaging simulation project, achieving a tenfold increase in simulation speed by implementing hardware acceleration with \textbf{C#/.NET} and NVIDIA \textbf{CUDA C}. My role included conducting weekly progress meetings, documentation in a lab book, and presenting results, which enabled simulations to complete in a lunch break instead of overnight.

 Selected for Leonardo's Systems Engineering Year in Industry program straight from high school, I developed software to simulate specialised synthetic aperture radar ground imaging. This involved creating a "virtual" flight trial using digital terrain from freely available map data. The transition required significant adaptation; I completed a five-day company radar course, learned to develop robust \textbf{C#/.NET} software to company standards, and built resilience and self-awareness. My contributions earned multiple Year in Industry awards and led to an invitation to return the following summer.

I graduated from the James-Watt School of Engineering \textbf{with Honours of the First Class}. My degree includes a practical mix of electronic design with computing science theory and application.
I have enjoyed working on team projects throughout my studies. For two such projects in my final year, I took on the role of lead programmer. This involved managing our team's overall direction and ownership of event-driven software in \textbf{C/C++} . As part of GUSTS - Glasgow University Sustainable Technology Society I served as Projects Manager in the 2020-2021 committee group and helped organise events promoting sustainable engineering projects on campus. I've also been a keen member of the University Surf Club, which has been a lot of fun. Finally, I enjoyed serving as a lab demonstrator for a \textbf{Python} web app development course, where I learned teaching methods and solidified my own knowledge.
